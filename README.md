# Gender Detection System

This repository contains a gender detection system built using TensorFlow and Keras, designed to classify faces as male or female. The project includes model training, prediction scripts, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction. The model achieved an accuracy of **99.08%** during training.

## Training the Model

To train the model, navigate to the `training` directory and run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

Make sure your dataset is properly structured within the `dataset` folder.

## Testing the Model

To test the trained model, you can use the `predict.py` or `webcam_predict.py` scripts found in the `inference` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the GUI**:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
   This will launch a graphical user interface for uploading images.

2. **Make Predictions**:
   - Use the GUI to upload an image or capture a photo using your webcam.
   - The model will classify the face as male or female.

## Application and Usages

- **Real-time Gender Detection**: Utilize the webcam for live detection.
- **Image Classification**: Analyze existing images to classify gender.
- **Educational Purposes**: Learn about gender classification and machine learning techniques.
