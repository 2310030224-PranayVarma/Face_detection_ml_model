# Gender Detection System

This repository contains a gender detection system built using TensorFlow and Keras, designed to classify faces as male or female. The project includes model training, prediction scripts, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Tkinter (for GUI)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python
```

```

## Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
/opt/conda/bin/python /workspaces/Gender_Detection_System_ML/face_detection_system/training/train.py
```

This will start the training process, and upon successful completion, the final model will be saved in the `models` directory as `final_face_detection_model.keras`.

### Final Validation Accuracy

After training, you will see the output indicating the final validation accuracy. 

```
final validation accuracy : 0.9908 (99.08%)
```

## Testing the Model

You can test the model using the provided scripts:

### Predict an Image

To predict the gender of a specific image, run:

```bash
/opt/conda/bin/python /workspaces/Gender_Detection_System_ML/face_detection_system/inference/predict.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the image path. The model will then output the prediction (Male/Female).

### Webcam Prediction

To perform real-time predictions using your webcam, run:

```bash
/opt/conda/bin/python /workspaces/Gender_Detection_System_ML/face_detection_system/inference/webcam_predict.py
```

Make sure your webcam is connected, and the script will label the detected gender in real-time.

### GUI Application

To use a graphical user interface for image uploads and predictions, run:

```bash
/opt/conda/bin/python /workspaces/Gender_Detection_System_ML/face_detection_system/inference/gui.py
```

This will open a window where you can upload an image for gender classification.
